**Project Brief**:
In my **Devanagari Sentiment Analysis** project, I focused on analyzing the sentiment of text written in the Devanagari script. The main goal was to classify the sentiments of the text as positive, negative, or neutral. The sentiments were identified based on the emotional tone conveyed in the text.

**Sentiments Analyzed**:
- **Positive Sentiment**: Texts that express favorable emotions or opinions, such as happiness, satisfaction, or approval.
- **Negative Sentiment**: Texts that express unfavorable emotions or opinions, such as anger, frustration, or disapproval.
- **Neutral Sentiment**: Texts that don't have a strong emotional tone, like factual statements or neutral observations.

**Approach**:
1. **Data Collection**: I gathered a dataset containing texts in the Devanagari script with labeled sentiment values (positive, negative, neutral). The data was collected from various sources, including social media posts, movie reviews, and product reviews.
   
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Text cleaning: Removed unnecessary characters, special symbols, and stop words.
   - Tokenization: Split the text into smaller units (tokens) like words or phrases.
   - Lemmatization: Reduced words to their root form to handle variations (e.g., “happy” and “happiness” as the same).

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Used **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the text data into numerical vectors representing the importance of words in the text.
   - Also experimented with **Word2Vec** embeddings to capture semantic meanings.

4. **Modeling**:
   - I trained machine learning models such as **Naive Bayes**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Random Forest** on the processed data to predict the sentiment.
   - Later, I fine-tuned the models using hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the models using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** to measure how well the models predicted the sentiment.
   - I used a validation dataset to test the generalization of the model.

This project helped me gain a better understanding of how to work with non-Latin scripts and implement NLP techniques for sentiment analysis. It also gave me practical experience in working with machine learning models and text preprocessing methods.
