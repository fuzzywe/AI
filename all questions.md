**1.	What is the difference between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?**
   
**supervised learning** gives output based on the learned data (images from moon).

  **Self-supervised learning** is a type of machine learning where the system learns to predict part of its input from other parts of the 
  
  input without requiring labeled data. It is a form of unsupervised learning where the model generates its own labels based on the inherent
  
  structure of the input data.
  
 ** Self-Supervised Learning:** Self-supervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data by generating pseudo-labels from the data 
  
  itself. For instance, in language modeling, a model predicts the next word in a sentence without explicit labels
  
   "Where can self-supervised learning be beneficial in real-world applications?" Answer: "In autonomous driving systems, self-supervised 
   
   learning can predict future movements of vehicles by analyzing patterns in historical data, thereby improving navigation and safety on the 
   
   roads."
  
  For example, in image classification, a model learns to classify images based on predefined labels such as "cat" or "dog". Similarly, in 
  
  spam detection, the model identifies whether an email is spam or not based on labeled training data. 


  RL is based on a reward feedback loop, allowing the agent to learn from its experiences.
