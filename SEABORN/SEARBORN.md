**Step 2: Interview Questions with Answers**

Q1: What are the key advantages of using Seaborn over Matplotlib for data visualization?

A1: Seaborn offers several advantages over Matplotlib:
- Built-in statistical functionality and automatic handling of categorical variables
- More aesthetic default styling and themes
- Simplified syntax for complex visualizations
- Automatic color palette management and legend creation
- Native integration with pandas DataFrames

Real-world example: Think of Matplotlib as a basic art set with individual colors and brushes (requiring manual selection), while Seaborn is like a professional design suite with pre-configured templates and color schemes. Just as a professional designer can work more efficiently with templates, data scientists can create sophisticated visualizations more quickly with Seaborn.

Q2: How would you create a correlation heatmap in Seaborn and what insights can it provide?

A2: To create a correlation heatmap in Seaborn:
```python
correlation = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation, annot=True, cmap='Blues', 
            square=True, fmt='.2f')
```
Real-world application: In a housing price prediction model, a heatmap might reveal that square footage has a strong positive correlation (0.8) with price, while crime rate has a negative correlation (-0.4). This is like a weather heat map where red indicates hot spots (strong positive correlations) and blue indicates cold spots (negative correlations).

Q3: What is the significance of the `sns.set_theme()` function in Seaborn?

A3: `sns.set_theme()` establishes a consistent visual style across all plots by:
- Setting a default color palette
- Configuring grid lines and background
- Adjusting font sizes and styles
- Standardizing plot elements

Think of it as establishing a corporate brand guide - just as companies maintain consistent visual identity across all materials, `set_theme()` ensures all your visualizations maintain a consistent, professional appearance.

Q4: Explain the difference between `sns.countplot()` and `sns.barplot()` with examples.

A4: These plots serve different purposes:
- `countplot()`: Shows the count of observations in each categorical bin
- `barplot()`: Displays the mean of a numeric variable for each category

Real-world example: In a retail scenario:
- `countplot()` would show how many customers visited each day of the week
- `barplot()` would show the average spending per day of the week

Q5: How would you handle overlapping data points in a Seaborn scatter plot?

A5: Several approaches can be used:
```python
# Using alpha for transparency
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='x', y='y', alpha=0.5)

# Using jitter
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='x', y='y', x_jitter=True)

# Using size to indicate point density
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='x', y='y', size='count')
```
This is similar to solving overcrowding in a photograph - you might adjust transparency, slightly move overlapping elements, or use size to indicate density.

[Note: I can continue with more questions, but I wanted to check if you'd like me to proceed with more questions or if you'd like any modifications to the current format.]

sns.distplot(data['column_name'])
```
It provides insights about:
- The range and spread of data
- The central tendency
- The presence of outliers
- The shape of distribution (normal, skewed, etc.)
For example, in the housing price distribution, we could identify the most common price ranges and potential market segments.

**Q4: What is the significance of the sns.set_theme() function and when should it be used?**
**A4:** sns.set_theme() is used to set the default visual theme for all Seaborn plots in a session. It's important because:
- It provides consistent styling across all visualizations
- Improves readability with proper spacing and grids
- Only needs to be called once at the beginning of your analysis
- Can be customized based on specific needs (presentation, publication, etc.)

**Q5: How would you handle categorical vs. numerical variables differently in Seaborn plots?**
**A5:** Seaborn provides different plotting functions for categorical and numerical variables:
- Categorical: countplot(), boxplot(), violinplot()
- Numerical: distplot(), regplot(), histplot()
For example, in the Titanic dataset, we used countplot for categorical variables like survival status and class, while numerical variables like age would be better visualized using distribution plots.
