Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data
sample. The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given
data sample is to be split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation. When a
specific value for k is chosen, it may be used in place of k in the reference to the model, such as k=10
becoming 10-fold cross-validation. Mainly used in backgrounds where the objective is forecast, and one
wants to estimate how accurately a model will accomplish in practice.
Cross-validation is primarily used in applied machine learning to estimate the skill of a machine learning
model on unseen data. That is, to use a limited sample in order to estimate how the model is expected to
perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model.
It is a popular method because it is simple to understand and because it generally results in a less biased
or less optimistic estimate of the model skill than other methods, such as a simple train/test split.
