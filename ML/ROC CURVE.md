### **What is an ROC Curve?**

The **ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)** is a graphical plot used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. It shows the tradeoff between the **True Positive Rate (TPR)** and the **False Positive Rate (FPR)** at various classification thresholds.

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **True Positive Rate (TPR)**:
   - Also called **Sensitivity** or **Recall**.
   - Measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model.
   - Formula:
     \[
     TPR = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{False Negatives (FN)}}
     \]

2. **False Positive Rate (FPR)**:
   - Measures the proportion of actual negatives incorrectly classified as positives.
   - Formula:
     \[
     FPR = \frac{\text{False Positives (FP)}}{\text{False Positives (FP)} + \text{True Negatives (TN)}}
     \]

3. **Threshold**:
   - The cutoff value used to classify a data point as positive or negative.
   - Example: If the predicted probability ≥ 0.5, classify as positive; otherwise, classify as negative.

---

### **How is the ROC Curve Plotted?**
- The ROC Curve is created by plotting **TPR (y-axis)** against **FPR (x-axis)** for different threshold values.
- Each point on the curve represents a specific threshold.

---

### **Interpreting the ROC Curve**
1. **Perfect Classifier**:
   - The curve passes through the top-left corner (TPR = 1, FPR = 0).
   - This means the model has no false positives and no false negatives.

2. **Random Guess**:
   - The curve follows a diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right.
   - This means the model performs no better than random guessing.

3. **Good Classifier**:
   - The curve is closer to the top-left corner.
   - The larger the area under the curve, the better the model.

---

### **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**
- The **AUC** is a single metric derived from the ROC Curve.
- It measures the entire area under the ROC Curve.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **AUC = 1**: Perfect classifier.
  - **AUC = 0.5**: Random guess.
  - **AUC > 0.5**: Better than random guessing.

### **Example of an ROC Curve**

Suppose we have the following predictions and true labels for a binary classification problem:

| **Instance** | **True Label** | **Predicted Probability** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 1            | 1              | 0.9                       |
| 2            | 0              | 0.4                       |
| 3            | 1              | 0.7                       |
| 4            | 0              | 0.6                       |
| 5            | 1              | 0.8                       |

#### Step 1: Sort by Predicted Probability
| **Instance** | **True Label** | **Predicted Probability** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 1            | 1              | 0.9                       |
| 5            | 1              | 0.8                       |
| 3            | 1              | 0.7                       |
| 4            | 0              | 0.6                       |
| 2            | 0              | 0.4                       |

#### Step 2: Calculate TPR and FPR at Different Thresholds
- **Threshold = 0.9**:
  - TP = 1, FP = 0, FN = 2, TN = 2
  - TPR = 1 / (1 + 2) = 0.33
  - FPR = 0 / (0 + 2) = 0

- **Threshold = 0.8**:
  - TP = 2, FP = 0, FN = 1, TN = 2
  - TPR = 2 / (2 + 1) = 0.67
  - FPR = 0 / (0 + 2) = 0

- **Threshold = 0.7**:
  - TP = 3, FP = 0, FN = 0, TN = 2
  - TPR = 3 / (3 + 0) = 1
  - FPR = 0 / (0 + 2) = 0

- **Threshold = 0.6**:
  - TP = 3, FP = 1, FN = 0, TN = 1
  - TPR = 3 / (3 + 0) = 1
  - FPR = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5

- **Threshold = 0.4**:
  - TP = 3, FP = 2, FN = 0, TN = 0
  - TPR = 3 / (3 + 0) = 1
  - FPR = 2 / (2 + 0) = 1

#### Step 3: Plot the ROC Curve
- Plot the points: (0, 0.33), (0, 0.67), (0, 1), (0.5, 1), (1, 1).
- The curve will start at (0, 0), move up to (0, 1), and then move right to (1, 1).

### **Advantages of ROC Curve**
1. **Threshold Independence**:
   - Evaluates model performance across all possible thresholds.
2. **Imbalanced Data**:
   - Works well even when the classes are imbalanced.
3. **Visual Interpretation**:
   - Provides a clear visual representation of the tradeoff between TPR and FPR.

### **When to Use ROC Curve?**
- For binary classification problems.
- When you want to evaluate the performance of a model across different thresholds.
- When dealing with imbalanced datasets.

---

### **Summary**
- The **ROC Curve** plots TPR vs. FPR at various thresholds.
- The **AUC** summarizes the model's performance in a single metric.
- A good model has an ROC Curve closer to the top-left corner and a high AUC.

## **📌 ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) 🎯📊**  

The **ROC Curve** is a graphical representation used to evaluate the **performance of a classification model** (especially in binary classification). It shows the trade-off between **True Positive Rate (TPR)** and **False Positive Rate (FPR)** at different threshold values.  

---

## **🔹 Key Terms in ROC Curve**  

✅ **True Positive Rate (TPR) – Sensitivity/Recall**  
- Measures how many actual positives were correctly predicted.  
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  TPR = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
  \]
  
✅ **False Positive Rate (FPR)**  
- Measures how many actual negatives were incorrectly classified as positive.  
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  FPR = \frac{FP}{FP + TN}
  \]

✅ **Threshold**  
- The probability cutoff that decides whether a prediction is classified as **positive** or **negative**.  
- Lowering the threshold **increases TPR** but also **increases FPR**.  

✅ **Area Under the Curve (AUC - ROC Score)**  
- The **AUC (Area Under Curve)** represents the ability of the model to **distinguish between positive and negative classes**.  
- **AUC values interpretation:**  
  - **AUC = 1.0** → Perfect classifier ✅  
  - **AUC > 0.9** → Excellent model 🔥  
  - **AUC ≈ 0.8** → Good model 👍  
  - **AUC ≈ 0.7** → Fair model 🤔  
  - **AUC < 0.5** → Worse than random ❌  

---

## **🔹 ROC Curve Interpretation**  

- A **good model** should have a curve that is **closer to the top-left corner** (high TPR, low FPR).  
- A **random classifier** follows the diagonal **(AUC = 0.5, no discrimination ability)**.  
- A **bad model** would have an AUC < 0.5 (worse than random guessing).
