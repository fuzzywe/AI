R2 indicates how good the models fits the dataset where the values lies between 0 to 1(Worse-good) where we have many independent features there

we use adjusted R square which explains which features are helpful in making the predictions. 

MAE is calculated as true-predicted values, takes average of the error from every sample in the dataset and gives output.

But MSE is better to use when dataset has outliers, calculation wise we square the error value so there is no -ve values.

Basically,

R-Squared is defined as how much our regression line remove the error as we compared to our mean line.

------------------------------------------------------

Adjusted R-Squared is defined as the new R-Squared when we add or remove any columns.

--------------------------------------------------------

MSE is know Mean Squared Error, it is calculated as the difference of every observation with the mean, squared it and divided by the number of observation.

---------------------------------------------------

MAE is defined as the Mean Absolute error, it is calculated by the difference of every observation with its mean and find the mode of it then, divided by the number of observation.
