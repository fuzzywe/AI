Regression and classification are both types of supervised learning in machine learning, but they have distinct purposes:

### 🔹 **Regression**
- 📌 **Definition**: Predicts **continuous numerical values**.
- 📊 **Output Type**: Real-valued numbers (e.g., price, temperature, age).
- 🎯 **Example**: Predicting house prices based on features like size and location.
- 📈 **Algorithms**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- ✅ **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

---

### 🔹 **Classification**
- 📌 **Definition**: Predicts **categorical labels or classes**.
- 📊 **Output Type**: Discrete values (e.g., "Spam" or "Not Spam", "Cancer" or "No Cancer").
- 🎯 **Example**: Email spam detection (Spam vs. Not Spam).
- 📈 **Algorithms**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
  - Neural Networks
- ✅ **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC Score

| Feature            | Regression 🏠 | Classification 🎯 |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Output Type       | Continuous values (e.g., price, salary) | Categorical values (e.g., spam/not spam) |
| Example          | Predicting house prices | Detecting if an email is spam or not |
| Algorithms Used  | Linear Regression, SVR | Logistic Regression, Decision Trees |
| Metrics         | MSE, RMSE, MAE | Accuracy, Precision, Recall |

### 🔹 **Basic Questions**  

#### 1️⃣ What is a Decision Tree?  
✅ **Answer:**  
A **Decision Tree** is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for both **classification** and **regression**. It is a tree-like structure where:  
- **Nodes** represent features/attributes  
- **Branches** represent decision rules  
- **Leaves** represent the outcome/class labels  

It works by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the most significant attribute, using criteria like **Gini Impurity** or **Entropy** (Information Gain).  

#### 2️⃣ What are the key components of a Decision Tree?  
✅ **Answer:**  
- **Root Node**: The first node, representing the best split.  
- **Internal Nodes**: Intermediate decision points based on feature values.  
- **Branches**: The possible decisions at each node.  
- **Leaf Nodes**: The final output (classification or regression value).  

#### 3️⃣ How does a Decision Tree make predictions?  
✅ **Answer:**  
It follows a **top-down, recursive approach**:
1. Start from the **root node**.
2. Compare feature values and follow the appropriate branch.
3. Repeat this process until reaching a **leaf node**, which provides the final prediction.

### 🔹 **Intermediate Questions**  

#### 4️⃣ What are the splitting criteria used in Decision Trees?  
✅ **Answer:**  
The most common splitting criteria are:  
- **For Classification**:  
  - **Gini Impurity**: Measures how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly classified.  
  - **Entropy (Information Gain)**: Measures uncertainty in data; higher gain means better splits.  
- **For Regression**:  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  

#### 5️⃣ What is Overfitting in Decision Trees? How do you prevent it?  
✅ **Answer:**  
Overfitting occurs when the tree **memorizes** training data instead of generalizing well.  
🛠 **Ways to prevent overfitting:**  
- **Pruning**: Remove unnecessary branches (**pre-pruning, post-pruning**).  
- **Setting max depth**: Restricts how deep the tree can grow.  
- **Minimum samples per split/leaf**: Ensures enough data points for meaningful splits.  
- **Using ensemble methods**: Like **Random Forest** to improve generalization.  

#### 6️⃣ What is Pruning in Decision Trees?  
✅ **Answer:**  
**Pruning** is a technique to reduce overfitting by removing unnecessary branches:  
- **Pre-pruning (Early Stopping)**: Stop splitting when criteria like max depth are met.  
- **Post-pruning**: Build the tree first, then trim weak branches based on validation performance.

### 🔹 **Advanced Questions**  

#### 7️⃣ How do Decision Trees handle missing values?  
✅ **Answer:**  
- **Ignore missing values** during splitting.  
- **Impute missing values** using mean/median for regression or mode for classification.  
- **Use surrogate splits**, where alternative features are used when a value is missing.  

#### 8️⃣ What is the difference between Gini Impurity and Entropy?  
✅ **Answer:**  
| Feature | Gini Impurity 🔵 | Entropy 🔴 |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Definition | Probability of misclassification | Measure of uncertainty in a dataset |
| Formula | \( G = 1 - \sum p_i^2 \) | \( H = - \sum p_i \log_2 p_i \) |
| Range | 0 (pure) to 0.5 (maximum impurity) | 0 (pure) to 1 (maximum impurity) |
| Speed | Faster (less computation) | Slower (log calculation) |
| Preference | Used in **CART** (Classification and Regression Trees) | Used in **ID3, C4.5** |

✅ **When to Use?**  
- **Gini** is computationally faster and preferred in **large datasets**.  
- **Entropy** is more **mathematically intuitive** and used when understanding uncertainty matters.  

#### 9️⃣ How does a Decision Tree compare to Random Forest?  
✅ **Answer:**  
| Feature | Decision Tree 🌳 | Random Forest 🌲🌲🌲 |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Model Type | Single tree | Multiple trees (ensemble) |
| Accuracy | Lower (prone to overfitting) | Higher (reduces variance) |
| Interpretability | Easy to understand | Harder to interpret |
| Overfitting | More likely | Less likely |
| Computation | Faster | Slower |

✅ **Key takeaway**: Random Forest improves performance by combining multiple Decision Trees, reducing overfitting.  

#### 🔟 Why do Decision Trees suffer from high variance?  
✅ **Answer:**  
- Small changes in training data can create **very different** trees.  
- Prone to **overfitting**, capturing noise instead of patterns.  
- **Solution**: Use **pruning** or ensemble methods like **Random Forest**.
