- 📊 **Data Collection**: Begin with a labeled dataset (e.g., identifying "cat" or "dog").
- 🖼️ **Feature Extraction**: Identify distinguishing features like color or shape for classification.
- 🤖 **Model Training**: Use machine learning to map features to correct classes, finding patterns.
- 📝 **Model Evaluation**: Test the trained model with new data to assess accuracy.
- 🔮 **Prediction**: Apply the model to predict new data classes based on learned features.
- 📈 **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance with metrics for accuracy and reliability.

### Interview Questions:
1. **How do you ensure the quality of your dataset before training a model?**
   - *Answer:* "Before training, I verify the accuracy and consistency of labels in the dataset to ensure reliable model outcomes."

2. **Can you give an example of feature extraction in a real-world scenario?**
   - *Answer:* "In image recognition, features like edges and textures distinguish between different objects, such as identifying cancer cells in medical imaging."

3. **Why is model evaluation crucial in machine learning?**
   - *Answer:* "Evaluation ensures our model performs well on new data, validating its ability to make accurate predictions in real-world applications."

4. **What metrics would you use to evaluate a classification model?**
   - *Answer:* "Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, tailored to specific needs like minimizing false positives in medical diagnostics."
