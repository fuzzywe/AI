so what is regression analysis

**Regression analysis  is used  to predict a continuous outcome  and finds the relation ship between the given  input variable.**

we have a dataset we divide into 2 sets i.e some percentage to training data set and some percentage of data to testing data set, 

now we train a model using training data set  trading volume is high, the price tends to increase slightly the next day. 

and after model is trained we test the

accuracy of this model using testing data set and try to make predictions for the data that is yet to come..
