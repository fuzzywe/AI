Hereâ€™s a comparison between **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** in a corrected table format:

| Aspect                          | Linear Regression                                                                                     | Logistic Regression                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Activation Function**         | No activation function is used.                                                                       | Uses a sigmoid activation function to convert a linear equation into a logistic form.                     |
| **Threshold Value**             | No threshold value is needed.                                                                        | A threshold value (e.g., 0.5) is applied to classify the output as a binary category (0 or 1).           |
| **Error Calculation**           | Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is commonly used to measure model performance.                         | Log Loss or Cross-Entropy Loss is used instead of RMSE for error calculation.                            |
| **Dependent Variable Type**     | The dependent variable should be continuous and numeric (e.g., predicting prices, temperatures).    | The dependent variable is categorical (often binary) and typically represents classes (e.g., 0 or 1).   |
| **Goal**                        | Predicts a continuous value based on input features.                                                 | Predicts the probability of a class or category based on input features.                                |
| **Estimation Method**           | Based on least squares estimation to find the best-fit line.                                         | Uses maximum likelihood estimation to find the best-fit parameters for the classification boundary.       |

### Key Differences:
- **Linear Regression** is used for **regression tasks** (predicting continuous values), while **Logistic Regression** is used for **classification tasks** (predicting class probabilities).
- Logistic Regression transforms the output of a linear equation using the **sigmoid function**, making it suitable for **binary classification** problems.
